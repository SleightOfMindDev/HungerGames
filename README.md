# HungerGames
This plugin creates a Hunger Games inspired minigame for Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft servers. The plugin is kit focused, where each player can choose a kit that provides them unique abilities and starting equipment. 
The kit system is highly modular, allowing the programmer to easily add new kits to the plugin, and the variety of kits is only constrained by the limits of the Bukkit API.

## Authors
This plugin was made without any version control system in place, so it was retroactively migrated to git. As such, although the Author Dates of the commits are accurate, the authors of the commits are not. Below are the developers of the plugin, all of which invested approximately equal effort developing the plugin:

Ryan Butler (https://github.com/TheButlah)
