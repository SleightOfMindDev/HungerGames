# HungerGames
This plugin creates a Hunger Games inspired minigame for Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft servers. The plugin is kit focused, where each player can choose a kit that provides them unique abilities and starting equipment. 
The kit system is highly modular, allowing the programmer to easily add new kits to the plugin, and the variety of kits is only constrained by the limits of the Bukkit API.
